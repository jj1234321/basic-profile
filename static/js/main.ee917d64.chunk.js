Through my work with Siemen Software\'s Advanced Solutions team, I have studied knowledge graphs and semantic databases. I have also used Tensorflow to create deep learning neural networks for use with image recognition and worked on systems used for data labelling. I analyzed and implemented new approaches to machine learning, such as Deep Q-Learning from Demonstration. I have studied Database Theory and Information Retrieval topics, allowing me to create and navigate my own data structures from scratch. My experience working with a research team has also helped me understand how to deal with shifting priorities.\\n\\n When it comes to general development, my previous experience working with legacy code is my greatest strength. I hyper-focus on environment I am introduced to until it becomes my own, which was helpful during my work at my previous company, having been moved around 3 different teams in the space of two years. \\n\\nI want to expand upon my previous experiences with machine learning, database creation, and navigation."}')},function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse("{\"a\":\"Co-op Experiences\\n\\nMy co-op experiences have been with Siemens Software in Milford. I have worked for three separate teams during my time working with them. \\n\\nFirst Rotation: Siemens PLM Software Structure Manager Team\\nTitle: Strategic Co-op \\nDates of Involvement: January 2017 - May 2017\\nMy first co-op rotation was with the Structure Manager team for Active Workspace, the web implementation of Siemens' Teamcenter product. I worked with writing tests using Cucumber. During this time, I learned about the three-tier development method of web design using Model, View, and Controller (MVC). I also learned about using chrome's dev tools to debug a front-end web solution. Another major component of this semester was legacy code development. My manager went out of his way to make sure I had reading materials for best practices and the importance of being able to work with and improve legacy systems. I also was exposed to C++ development in a legacy environment.\\n\\n\\nSecond Rotation: Siemens PLM Software Structure Manager Team\\nTitle: Strategic Co-op \\nDates of Involvement: August 2017 - December 2017\\nMy second co-op rotation was with the Structure Manager team for Active Workspace once again. The biggest change was the exposure to the Agile method of developing a product. I was able to participate in scrums and learn about how different developers working in certain parts of the codebase could help one another. I also spent a significant amount of time working with Javascript, modernizing a solution we changed to the Angular method of development to better utilize selectors. \\n\\n\\nThird Rotation: Siemens PLM Software 4th Generation Design Team\\nTitle: Strategic Co-op \\nDates of Involvement: May 2018 - August 2018\\nMy third rotation saw me changing to the Fourth Generation Development (4GD) section of Active Workspace's development. In this group, I learned about the layers of bureaucracy it can take to implement a new feature in a legacy product. I created an improvement to Teamcenter for Electric Boats using Java. I created and modified karma tests for Javascript during this time, as well. This rotation also had my first exposure to React. \\n\\n\\nFourth Rotation: Siemens PLM Software Advanced Solutions Team\\nTitle: Strategic Co-op \\nDates of Involvement: January 2019 - May 2019\\nMy fourth rotation was with the Advanced Solutions division of Siemens. While with this team, I architected a front-end solution for a potential product. This required implementing HTML5 features which were not known to all browsers. I utilized React as my framework for the project, and the project went through three separate versions during my semester there. I became familiar with Javascript + CSS + HTML methods and patterns for web design. I also spent time researching semantic databases generally and Stardog specifically, well enough to be able to query a triple store using SPARQL. During this rotation, I learned about the pressure that can come with needing to deliver a product on time; how to create compromises with management and make sure that shareholders were aware of how far along the project was. I also learned how to use Git and Docker during this time. \\n\\n\\nFifth Rotation: Siemens PLM Software Advanced Solutions Team\\nTitle: Strategic Co-op \\nDates of Involvement: May 2019 - August 2019\\nFor my fifth and last co-op rotation, I remained at Siemens Software's Advanced Solutions team. Due to my previous experience, I was assigned to implementing a reactive front-end solution for another project. I also helped to debug and document a front-end solution for another toolkit that we were working that involved machine learning. During this time, I was exposed to a project from Georgia Tech that utilized Deep Q Learning From Demonstration to suggest state changes to the user. I learned about how to use Tensorflow as a result. I explored the possible implementations of a 'knowledge graph', and gathered enough information to accurately represent results for a (semantic database's) triple store in WebVowl format. I spent time learning to create presentations about the research I had performed, well enough that I could communicate that learning with others using PowerPoint. I was also able to mentor a fellow intern during this semester. This let me use my experience to help them to excel. \"}")},function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"a":"Career Goals:\\n\\nI plan on becoming an expert in the field of Data Science. The potential I see for data being utilized to better the lives of people excites me. I want to be at the forefront of this kind of research. I want to be able to watch the world change as a result of these techniques being implemented. I want to create systems that make it easier to implement these kinds of techniques. I see myself getting my Masters in artificial intelligence and eventually a PhD in that field. I am not interested in research; I want to see the applications of these ideas and mentor/enable others to continue those implementations. \\n\\nStrengths\\n\\nCommunication\\nFor me, communication means that I am using what I know to improve the effectiveness of those around me. During my fifth and final co-op, I was required to research a new implementation of a machine learning project. The project had several bugs; during the course of the semester, any bugs I encountered which I believed I had the solution to, I would pass those ideas back to the development team for the project. I did not have the solution myself; but the insights I was able to gather would be helpful in solving those issues. Even if I do not know the answer to a problem, my ability to communicate what I do know will help me find more effective solutions in the future. \\n\\nLeadership\\nTo me, leadership is the ability to take a problem and say \'this is how we will resolve it\'. During my fourth co-op rotation, I was required to take leadership over the architecture of a web application. I decided to use the React framework, which greatly increased the speed at which I was able to develop the product. This choice of implementation meant that I was later able to use those components for other projects, and use them as educational materials for co-ops who would join our team during our fifth rotation. This sense of leadership and exploring different solutions will help me to find innovative ways of improving processes and ending confusion among my team members. \\n\\nMentorship\\nMy biggest achievement during my fifth rotation was mentoring a fellow intern on my team. I would do pair programming to show how I would approach a solution; after a few examples, I was no longer needed, and that intern was able to complete several similar projects. That mentorship also came back to help me; because of that interaction I had shared, my relationships at work improved, and I was able to be mentored in return on subjects that that intern was more experienced in than myself.\\n\\nCompromise\\nOne example of my compromising nature that comes to mind is my time working with the Boy Scouts of America. There were numerous incidents where we needed to do the dishes after having eaten dinner. I understood that no member of my troop inherently wanted to do dishes; however, that said, in my position of leadership I had to make sure it got done. Therefore, I tried to find a middle ground of sorts; I would always look for the solution that made sure each member of my troop knew I was thinking about them in some regard. Whether that was making sure we played some kind of game together after dinner, or organizing the schedule in such a manner that satisfied each member of the cleanup crew. It did take a bit more work on my end, but overall it was a lot more fun working with an engaged clean-up crew than one who had been impressed into doing the job. \\n\\nResearching\\nDuring my last two co-op rotations, I was with a research team. I learned that I enjoyed performing research tasks to improve the knowledge base of my team. One of those things that I researched was the React framework. I faced pushback on implementing this framework; so I created a presentation on its advantages for my team. Ultimately, this resulted in me being able to produce a front end solution using React as the framework, and the experiences I gained from that implementation I was able to later implement with refactoring a different web application."}')},function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"a":"Personal Projects\\n\\nBasic React App:\\nThe website you are viewing this profile on is something that I came up with, using the experience I gained from my fourth co-op rotation. (~3/20/2019). I created it on my own time using techniques I learned while at Siemens Software. I used React and React Router to create the project. I used Github Pages and the gh-pages React package to host it. I did it to create a set of universal tools for presenting information. I also created a set of components that would allow for one to create an organizational chart, or roster, with images accompanying each one. I learned how to import images into a webapp, how to host a webapp using Github Pages, and how to use github generally as a result of this project. \\n\\nDiscord Management Bot:\\nI created a discord bot for managing tasks in a pin on 5/24/2018. In August of 2019 I began rapidly improving upon it. It uses Discord JS, a Javascript library for managing data. I learned how to manipulate strings extensively through this library\'s implementation. While I did not have access to a back-end, I learned how to use pins as a temporary data-store, and also learned how to use Vultr to host a private server for my bot. \\n\\nPersonal Activities\\n\\nSummer Church Program - June 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015\\nI was a group leader for a group of schoolchildren for Faith Community United Methodist Church for four years. During this time, I was able to apply techniques I had learned about leadership from Scouting with a group of individuals who were not always focused on their current task. Every summer I was able to be a group leader, I felt like I made a difference from my participation in this program. \\n\\nBearcats Band Member - Fall 2015\\nDuring fall of 2015, I played percussion for the Bearcats Marching Band. I had experience playing percussion throughout high school, and was able to use this experience with the band program here at the university. For six months we practiced and performed in various parades, football games, and a competition event. \\n\\nBoy Scouts of America - Eagle Scout\\nMy proudest achievement is the Eagle Scout rank that I was able to accomplish at the end of my career with the Boy Scouts of America. My Eagle Scout Project was creating a patio for outdoor events at Gorman Heritage Farms in Glendale, Ohio.\\n\\nLeadership Activities\\nBoy Scouts Program - Senior Patrol Leader (Fall 2014)\\nDuring the Fall of 2014, I was the Senior Patrol Leader for Troop 962 of West Chester, Ohio. This was the last position I would have as a member of Troop 962, and during that time I was responsible for organizing troop campouts, implementing new ideas for the troop, coordinating with adult leadership within the troop, and managing the various patrol leaders. I learned about managing a group of other leaders with their own ambitions and goals. I also learned about how to deal with being the top member of an organization that has others in an organization even above them. I distinctly remember being in a position where I felt like I needed help from someone else, but the only one who could provide leadership at the time was me, so I had to rise to the occasion, such as when I discovered a rough situation between two of the members of my troop.
